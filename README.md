The curve uses Cubic interpolation with Catmull-Rom Splines , it was reparametrized by arc length using a table  and an easing function to accelerate from the start position and decelerate until the start position. 

A line renderer is used to show the curve the object is moving along. 

When press “B” button, the object will go with Bezier curves using the de Casteljau algorithm.
